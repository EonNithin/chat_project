The aim of this experiment is to find the dependence of a potential difference across a resistor and the current flowing through it. Similarly, you can do the calculations for voltmeter. Here we have taken the nickel wire. Then note down the voltmeter reading. On the graph, you can observe that the resistance can be calculated by the slope of the graph, which is passing through the origin. This shows that V is directly proportional to I. The graph that shows that voltage is directly proportional to current for a fixed temperature. (
